# AltStore PAL Repository for HackerWeb

This repository contains the files prepared for AltStore PAL distribution of [HackerWeb](https://github.com/cheeaun/hackerweb-native-2).

## 📁 Repository Structure

```
.
├── PALSource.json          # PAL source configuration
├── adp/                    # AltStore Distribution Package
└── README.md               # This file
```

**⚠️ Important**: The `adp/` folder contains critical distribution files. The directory hierarchy must be preserved exactly, and the hashes of each file must not change. In other words, DO NOT modify the `manifest.json` in any way (e.g prettifying). [Learn more](https://faq.altstore.io/developers/distribute-with-altstore-pal)
